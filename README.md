workouts
========

Simple workout tracker stores progress with HTML5 LocalStorage.

Currently it's setup for part of the P90x workout program and in the very early stages of development. I'm currently migrating it from my jQuery prototype to angular.js.

See the work in progress here:

[jQuery version](http://www.cameronhill.net/dev/workout/index.html)
[angular.js version](http://www.cameronhill.net/dev/workout/angular.html)


TODO:
- finish functionality
- test more
- use d3.js to chart progress of each exericse
- allow user to download data
